# Preface {-}

This is the official lab manual for Bio 373L (Field Ecology) at the University of Texas at Austin.  
It is split into three parts:

  - Instructions and advice for scientific writing.
  - A series of tutorials on data manipulation, visualization, and analysis using R.
  - Instructions for field problems and major assignments in the class.

This document will be updated throughout the semester.
